ASDF: another system definition facility
========================================

If you want to use ASDF, read our manual:

    http://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/asdf.html

The first few sections, Loading ASDF, Configuring ASDF and Using ASDF,
will get you started as a simple user.

If you want to define your own systems, further read the section
Defining systems with defsystem.

More information and additional links can be found on ASDF's
home page at:
