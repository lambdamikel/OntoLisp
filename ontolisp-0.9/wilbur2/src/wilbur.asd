;;;
;;;   Preamble to the Gnu Lesser General Public License
;;;
;;;   Copyright (c) 2000 Franz Incorporated, Berkeley, CA 94704
;;;
;;;   The concept of the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1 ("LGPL") has been
;;;   adopted to govern the use and distribution of above-mentioned application. However,
;;;   the LGPL uses terminology that is more appropriate for a program written in C than
;;;   one written in Lisp. Nevertheless, the LGPL can still be applied to a Lisp program
;;;   if certain clarifications are made. This document details those clarifications.
;;;   Accordingly, the license for the open-source Lisp applications consists of this
;;;   document plus the LGPL. Wherever there is a conflict between this document and the
;;;   LGPL, this document takes precedence over the LGPL.
;;;
;;;   A "Library" in Lisp is a collection of Lisp functions, data and foreign modules.
;;;   The form of the Library can be Lisp source code (for processing by an interpreter)
;;;   or object code (usually the result of compilation of source code or built with some
;;;   other mechanisms). Foreign modules are object code in a form that can be linked
;;;   into a Lisp executable. When we speak of functions we do so in the most general way
;;;   to include, in addition, methods and unnamed functions. Lisp "data" is also a
;;;   general term that includes the data structures resulting from defining Lisp classes.
;;;   A Lisp application may include the same set of Lisp objects as does a Library, but
;;;   this does not mean that the application is necessarily a "work based on the Library"
;;;   it contains.
;;;
;;;   The Library consists of everything in the distribution file set before any
;;;   modifications are made to the files. If any of the functions or classes in the
;;;   Library are redefined in other files, then those redefinitions ARE considered a
;;;   work based on the Library. If additional methods are added to generic functions in
;;;   the Library, those additional methods are NOT considered a work based on the
;;;   Library. If Library classes are subclassed, these subclasses are NOT considered a
;;;   work based on the Library. If the Library is modified to explicitly call other
;;;   functions that are neither part of Lisp itself nor an available add-on module to
;;;   Lisp, then the functions called by the modified Library ARE considered a work based
;;;   on the Library. The goal is to ensure that the Library will compile and run without
;;;   getting undefined function errors.
;;;
;;;   It is permitted to add proprietary source code to the Library, but it must be done
;;;   in a way such that the Library will still run without that proprietary code present.
;;;   Section 5 of the LGPL distinguishes between the case of a library being dynamically
;;;   linked at runtime and one being statically linked at build time. Section 5 of the
;;;   LGPL states that the former results in an executable that is a "work that uses the
;;;   Library." Section 5 of the LGPL states that the latter results in one that is a
;;;   "derivative of the Library", which is therefore covered by the LGPL. Since Lisp only
;;;   offers one choice, which is to link the Library into an executable at build time, we
;;;   declare that, for the purpose applying the LGPL to the Library, an executable that
;;;   results from linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library is considered a
;;;   "work that uses the Library" and is therefore NOT covered by the LGPL.
;;;
;;;   Because of this declaration, section 6 of LGPL is not applicable to the Library.
;;;   However, in connection with each distribution of this executable, you must also
;;;   deliver, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the LGPL, the source code
;;;   of Library (or your derivative thereof) that is incorporated into this executable. 
;;;
;;; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;;
;;;
;;;   Purpose: System definition(s) for Wilbur2
;;;
;;;   We no longer support either The CMU Defsystem (by Mark Kantrowitz) nor Franz,
;;;   Inc.'s defsystem (as shipped with Allegro Common Lisp). Instead, after a lot of
;;;   "soul-searching" we -- perhaps a little reluctantly -- have decided to go with
;;;   ASDF. It seems to have become the norm. For your convenience, the function
;;;   MAKE-WILBUR has been defined (internal in the CL-USER package).
;;;
;;;   Wilbur relies on the logical pathname host "wilbur". Here's a sample of how to set
;;;   up the pathname translations on a Unix-style system:
;;;
;;;     (("base;**;*.*"  "/Users/ora/Wilbur/**/*.*") ; this line is the example part
;;;      ("nox;*.*"      "wilbur:base;src;nox;*.*")
;;;      ("core;*.*"     "wilbur:base;src;core;*.*")
;;;      ("goodies;*.*"  "wilbur:base;src;goodies;*.*")
;;;      ("libs;**;*.*"  "wilbur:base;src;libs;**;*.*")
;;;      ("doc;*.*"      "wilbur:base;doc;*.*")
;;;      ("schemata;*.*" "wilbur:base;schemata;*.*"))
;;;
;;;   There's code below that attempts to define the above rules. It is not always easy
;;;   to understand how the Common Lisp logical pathname translations work. Please check
;;;   the translations (using TRANSLATE-LOGICAL-PATHNAME) before assuming that there are
;;;   bugs in Wilbur. :-)
